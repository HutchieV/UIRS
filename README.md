# **U**nified **I**ncident **R**eporting **S**ystem for Local &amp; Government Organisations (UIRS)

This is the code repository for the UIRS dissertation project, created for [Heriot-Watt University](www.hw.ac.uk)'s BSc. Computer Science degree (2020-21). This is not official.

## Purpose
UIRS's purpose is to provide members of the public with a web portal with which they can view location-specific updates on incidents as posted by local agencies such as councils, health boards and police forces. 

It will allow a member of the public to enter their postcode and receive information on events in their local area (defined using electorial wards). It will also allow the public to subscribe to push notifications for their selected postcodes.
